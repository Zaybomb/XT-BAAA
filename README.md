# XT-BAAA
XT-BAAA is going to be a very, very basic UI for Xemu on Termux and nothing else. I am not developing Xemu or Termux. XT-BAAA simply means Xemu Termux But As An App. I am literally just making a front end so we don't have to do so much typing in terminals. Maybe I'll add XISO conversion, but I am a horrible coder so far. No promises.

I could really use help with this, to be honest. Not trying to be more than it says on the tin. Only doing this due to a disappointment that happened yesterday. If you know you know.
